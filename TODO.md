# Import
- allow to define if match is against staged or published existing products (current it's staged)
- allow to define custom attribute for matching (eg. EAN, externalId etc.)
- allow to define image dimensions

### Command line options
- add option to re-index after import (new endpoint necessary)

### Ideas
- allow to define slug/externalId of category instead of id or tree path

### Questions
- How to handle attributes that are called like base attributes?
  (eg. name, description, productType, slug, etc.) - maybe some prefix like "."

# Export

  * image labels
  * image dimensions
